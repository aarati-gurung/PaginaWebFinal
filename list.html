                        <div><h3>1. Demon Slayer</h3></div>
                        <div><p>Love it or hate it, you have to accept the fact that Demon Slayer is one of the biggest names in the anime industry right now. In terms of popularity, Demon Slayer is along the same lines as Attack on Titan or Jujutsu Kaisen.

                            The main story of Demon Slayer is rather straightforward – you have a playful protagonist who fights against demons and flaunts a strong will to save the humans. However, when you dig deeper into the storyline, you truly realize the complexities and foreshadowing in the story. So, in that regard, Demon Slayer is very similar to Jujutsu Kaisen. On top of that, both series are setting a standard for other anime shows by giving remarkable animation and fight sequences.</p></div>

                    <div class="con1">
                        <div><h3>2. Bleach</h3></div>
                        <div><p>Bleach is a trendsetter anime series that returned to our screens after several years with its final story arc, Thousand Year Blood War. Focusing on Ichigo, a Shinigami trying to protect the world from Hollows and Soul Society from its enemies, Bleach does a lot of things right.

                            The world-building, animation, character development, and everything that Bleach does simply deserve a chef’s kiss. In Jujutsu Kaisen, we have Yuji Itadogi accidentally stumbling upon the world of curses, and in Bleach, there’s Ichigo, whom he bestowed upon by the responsibility of being a Shinigami. So, there are a lot of parallels between these two series.</p></div>

                        <div><h3>3. Tokyo Ghoul</h3></div>
                        <div><p>Tokyo Ghoul takes place in a world where ghoul exists among humans, just like in Jujutsu Kaisen, where curses exist in the human world.

                            Although Tokyo Ghoul comes with many aspects that make it closer to the concept of Jujutsu Kaisen, it is way too gorier. So, if you are someone who loves to explore dark and gritty storylines, you should watch Tokyo Ghoul.
                            
                            The story mainly revolves around a young man whose date tries to eat him. That’s the point in the story that reveals that this planet is threatened by the existence of ghouls, who have a taste for human flesh. What’s more threatening is that these ghouls live as humans, hiding their true nature from the world, which makes hunting humans more easy for them.</p></div>

                        <div><h3>4. Mob Psycho 100</h3></div>
                        <div><p>Mob Psycho 100 comes with a supernatural theme, just like Jujutsu Kaisen. Besides that, what makes it similar to the popular anime Jujutsu Kaisen is the relationship Mob shares with his mentor, Arataka Reigen. That’s quite similar to the relationship between Yuji and Gojo.

                            Mob Psycho 100 follows a young man named Mob, who possesses psychic powers, but he doesn’t learn the potential of his ability until he starts working under Arataka. Moreover, the series also comes with some well-choreographed fight scenes that make the experience more enjoyable.</p></div>

                        <div><h3>5. Chainsaw Man</h3></div>
                        <div><p>Here is another anime series that comes from MAPPA, and we can’t deny how well the studio has animated each frame of the anime series.

                            Chainsaw Man sees a young man, Denji, who basically lives on the streets with his pet Chainsaw Devil. To make things worse, Denji gets killed by a gangster, which leads the way to his merger with the Chainsaw Devil. Being resurrected as the Chainsaw Man, Denji becomes part of the Public Safety, who vows to fight the rogue devils. Jujutsu Kaisen is a story where sorcerers use curse techniques to fight the curses. Well, Chainsaw Man is a story where people who made contracts with the Devils fight the Devils who are a threat to humanity. So, the plot of these two shows couldn’t be more similar.</p></div>

                        <div><h3>6. Attack on titan</h3></div>
                        <div><p>Attack on Titan is one of the most legendary anime of all time. Similar to Jujutsu Kaisen, AoT comes with a dark and gory theme. Both anime make you fear for your beloved characters and make you question what is right and wrong.

                            AoT follows Eren Yeager, who vows to avenge his mother’s death by killing every existing Titan on the planet. Similarly, Yuji Itadori becomes a sorcerer at Jujutsu High to fight the curses that threaten humanity. So, you could say that both Yuji and Eren start off their journey so they can save humanity. Also, in JJK, Sorcerers use Cursed energy to fight off curses or other curse users, and along the same lines, Eldians from Paradis Island use the power of Titans to stand against Titans on the other side of the world.</p></div>
